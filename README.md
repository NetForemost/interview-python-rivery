# Third-Party API Implementation Test with Python and Rivery

In this test, you are expected to implement a third-party API using Python and Rivery to store data in a database. In this case, we will be using some third party API to get the data and store it in a PostgreSQL or Snowflake database.

## Description

You should create a Python script that connects to some API, get some data and stores it in a PostgreSQL or Snowflake database using the Rivery platform. The implementation should be robust and scalable, and you are expected to document the implementation process.

## Evaluation

The quality of the code, the correct implementation of third party API, the correct implementation of Rivery, and the correct implementation of the PostgreSQL or Snowflake database will be evaluated. The documentation of the implementation process in the README.md file will also be taken into account.

## About Rivery

[Rivery](https://rivery.io/) is a data integration platform that allows users to connect multiple data sources, transform them, and store them in a cloud database. Rivery supports a large number of connectors, including third-party APIs like the one used in this example.

## About PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

## About Snowflake

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) is a cloud data warehouse that can store and analyze all your data records in one place. It can automatically scale up/down its compute resources to load, integrate, and analyze data.
